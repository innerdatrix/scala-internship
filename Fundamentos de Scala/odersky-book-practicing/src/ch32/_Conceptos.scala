/*
Scala’s actors library does address the fundamental problem by providing
an alternative, share-nothing, message-passing model that programmers tend
to ﬁnd much easier to reason about. Actors are a good ﬁrst tool of choice
when designing concurrent software, because they can help you avoid the
deadlocks and race conditions that are easy to fall into when using the shared
data and locks model.
